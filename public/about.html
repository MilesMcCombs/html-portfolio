<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Miles McCombs. I am a full-time scaffold carpenter, part-time musician, and freelance software developer. I have been married to my incredible wife for 8 years, and we have 2 beautiful, crazy boys.</p>

<p>I grew up in the music industry, hanging out behind the scenes of my dad's live shows. Throughout the 90's, his band, Gracie Moon, opened for many legends of the blues, including B. B. King, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. Naturally, this created a strong foundation for my love of the live entertainment industry.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Music Business from Full Sail University, where I graduated as the Salutatorian of my class. However, I currently work a blue collar job because nothing else in my town pays the bills. I'm developing this portfolio, using courses I'm taking through Udemy, to showcase projects and milestones I accomplish. My ultimate goal is to work from home, making enough money to support my family, and spend more time doing the things I love.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoy the projects I share. For any questions, comments, or business inquiries, be sure to vist my <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>

<p>-Miles V.</p>
